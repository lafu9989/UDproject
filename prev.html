                    <h3>Cat Collector</h3>
                    <p>Last semester, I took the class CSCI 4448: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design. I worked with my friend to create a Cat Collector game, using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
                    <p>
                        The game was originally based on the mobile game <i>Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector</i>, in which players are able to use different treats and toys to lure various cat characters to their cat garden. 
                        My friend and I were both inspired by this game because we both have cats of our own. 
                    </p>

                    <section>
                        <h4>Technical Information</h4>
                        <p>The game is coded in Java with various Object-Oriented patterns (such as Factory, Strategy, etc.)</p>
                        <p>The player's game information is stored in a dynamic <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> file, stored with the rest of the game files. This allows a player's stats to be saved between games (such as number of cats attracted, inventory, etc.)</p>
                        <p>GitHub and Notion were used for project management and source code management.</p>
                    </section>

                        <h4>Design Process</h4>
                        <p>We started by designing an initial diagram of the app's infrastructure. We defined the client layer as the user's input (keyboard/mouse/etc.), the executable/code layer as the Java code we had written (which generated the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>), and the data layer as the various text files we used to store game information.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>From there, we began developing different features of the game, from designing the characters and sprites to defining the behavior and interactions between various game objects.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we began to incorporate object-oriented patterns into our game design. This prepared us to start coding the game! </p>
