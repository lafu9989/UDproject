            <h2>Lab #4: Accessible CSS Layout</h2>
            <p>In this assignment, we learned to use media queries and CSS grids and flexbox to create websites that are responsive. That is, they look equally good on screens of all sizes.</p>
            <p>I didn't really know what to put as the content of this website, so I put some pretty generic filler content about where I would put things, theoretically.</p>
            <p>I also chose to use a blue color scheme, which, looking back on it, was probably not the best choice, as many of the links were also styled to be blue in color, leading to a lack of contrast.</p>
            <p>Overall, I don't think is my best work, but it definitely taught me a lot which helped me to make both my final project and this class portal a lot better!</p>
