            <h2>Final Project: Universal Design Website</h2>
            <p>
                For the final project, we were asked to design a website making a convincing argument for Universal Design. 
                I began by creating an initial wireframe of my design for the website, and the content I wanted to include. I also made sure to consider how the website would look on mobile devices. 
                Then I created a skeleton of the website with filler content, to make sure that my styling worked. I also added some accessibility features such as a skip navigation link. 
                Finally, I began writing the content of the website, which I drafted in Word first before essentially pasting it into the website. After testing and making sure the content made sense and looked good on the website, I sent it to my friends and family to test that it worked on multiple devices. 
                Overall, working on this website was really rewarding, and it's probably the best-looking website I've ever made.
